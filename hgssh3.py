hgssh3.py - a wrapper for ssh access to mercurial repositories

To be used in ~/.ssh/authorized_keys with the "command" option, see sshd(8):
command="hgssh3 username /path/to/acl_file" ssh-rsa ...
(probably together with these other useful options:
no-port-forwarding,no-X11-forwarding,no-agent-forwarding)

This allows pull/push over ssh from/to repositories based on the username given as arguments with the ssh command.

If all your repositories are subdirectories of a common directory, you can
allow shorter paths with:
command="cd path/to/my/repositories && hgssh3 username /path/to/acl_file"

*******************
ACL_file format:

[myrepo1]
location=relative/path/to/repo #This is relative to the cwd (Current working directory) and cwd will default to ~/ unless changed using 'cd /path/to/repo &&' before calling the python script.
user1=write #Read/Write access
user2=read  #Read only access

[myrepo2]
location = relative/path/to/repo
user1=read
user4=read
user3=write


#Real example with 'repos' directory in the ~/ directory of the user (i.e. hg). User would check out as ssh://hg@my.server/project1:
[project1]
location=repos/customer1/project1
user1=write
user2=read


*********************
If the username provided in authorized_keys does not exist in the ACL file, or if it is set to anything
other than 'read' or 'write' (even if blank), then the access will be denied.

NOTE: The users defined in the ACL file DO NOT need to exist on the server being accessed. They simply need to match
      the entry that is provided in the command in the authorized_keys file for that user.

NOTE: The actual name of the repository folder in the location DOES NOT need to match the name in the [] section of the ACL file.
Example:
[repo1]
location=/path/to/repos/anothername
user1=read
user2=write

This script allows the use of 'short/friendly' names in access/config:
Example: ssh://hg@hg.myserver.com/myrepo1

This repository could actually live under ~/relative/path/to/repos/myrepo1. This ACL file serves as
a mapping from friendly name to actual location. This removes the need to defined multiple repo definitions
on the "command" of the ssh key as in hgssh, and also removes the need to redefine repos per user as in hgssh2.py. 
This configuration allows one definition of the repository and one line per user to deny/grant access. This is very similar
to how SVN grants access controls.
